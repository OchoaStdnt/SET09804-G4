## Code of Conduct:
#### 1. Teamwork and Collaboration
- Respect: All team members must treat each other with respect, listen to opinions, and ensure all voices are heard.
- Commitment: Team members are expected to actively participate in all group meetings, discussions, and tasks.
- Communication: Use clear, concise communication channels, and ensure that important decisions and progress updates are shared across the team.

#### 2. Roles and Responsibilities
- Task Assignment: Tasks will be assigned based on skills and interest, with an effort to rotate roles to ensure fair distribution of work.
- Accountability: Each member is responsible for their assigned tasks and must ensure timely completion.
- Support: Team members should offer support and help to others when needed, especially when a teammate is struggling to meet a deadline.

#### 3. Task Management and Tools
- GitHub: Use GitHub for version control, issue tracking, and project collaboration. All code must be committed to the relevant branches (e.g., master, develop) with meaningful commit messages.
- Zube.io: Use Zube for task tracking and sprint management. All tasks must be logged and updated as they progress.
- Kanban Board: The team must maintain an up-to-date Kanban board, reflecting the progress of the sprint and the state of tasks (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- Sprint Planning: The team will hold sprint planning meetings at the start of each sprint to agree on user stories and tasks. These should be tracked and prioritized effectively.

#### 4. Code Quality and Reviews
- Coding Standards: Follow industry best practices, including clear variable naming, comments, and proper formatting.
- Peer Review: Code must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging into the master branch. Reviews should focus on functionality, readability, and maintainability.
- Continuous Integration: Ensure that code passes tests and builds in the CI/CD pipeline before merging. All testing and code quality badges must remain up-to-date.

#### 5. Meeting Attendance via discord
- Punctuality: All members must arrive on time for meetings, code reviews, and sprint planning. Absences should be communicated in advance.
- Preparedness: All members must come prepared to meetings, with progress updates, blockers, and questions ready for discussion.

#### 6. Conflict Resolution
- Disagreements: Any team disputes or disagreements must be resolved respectfully. If consensus cannot be reached, the team will vote, and the majority decision will be implemented.
- Escalation: If conflicts cannot be resolved internally, they should be escalated to the module teaching team.

#### 7. Deadlines and Deliverables
- Timely Delivery: Ensure all deliverables (e.g., code reviews, sprint tasks, documentation) are submitted on time.
- Transparency: If a team member cannot meet a deadline, they must notify the team as early as possible.

#### 8. Contribution and Peer Assessment
- Equitable Contributions: Each team member must contribute fairly to the project. Contribution will be measured via GitHub activity, task completion, and attendance at meetings.
- Peer Review: Contributions will be reviewed and assessed by teammates as per the peer assessment guidelines. Honest, constructive feedback is expected.

#### 9. Breach of Code of Conduct
- Initial Warning: If a member violates the code of conduct, a formal warning will be issued by the team.
- Dismissal: Repeated violations may result in dismissal from the team. This will be escalated to the teaching team with evidence.
- Appeal: Any dismissed member has the right to appeal the decision within one week by providing evidence of mitigating circumstances.

####   By adhering to this code of conduct, we ensure a collaborative, respectful, and effective environment that fosters both individual and team success.
